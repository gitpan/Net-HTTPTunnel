0.1  Initial release

0.2  Fixed two bugs, one which included an additional carriage
return with proxy authorization, and one which prevented the
http-ver option from being recognized.

0.3  Fixed the capitalization of the "Proxy-Authorization" header in
case a fascist proxy did case-sensitive header matching.  Also, fixed
some mistakes in which \n\r was sent instead of \r\n.

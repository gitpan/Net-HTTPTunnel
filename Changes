    0.1 Initial Release

    0.2 Fixed two bugs, one which included an additional carriage return
    with proxy authorization, and one which prevented the http-ver option
    from being recognized.

    0.3 Fixed the capitalization of the "Proxy-Authorization" header in case
    a fascist proxy did case-sensitive header matching. Also, fixed some
    mistakes in which \n\r was sent instead of \r\n.

    0.4 Fixed a bug that would cause an instance of the module to assume
    success on all subsequent connections once it had gotten its first
    successful connection.

    0.1 Initial Release

    0.2 Fixed two bugs, one which included an additional carriage return
    with proxy authorization, and one which prevented the http-ver option
    from being recognized.

    0.3 Fixed the capitalization of the "Proxy-Authorization" header in case
    a fascist proxy did case-sensitive header matching. Also, fixed some
    mistakes in which \n\r was sent instead of \r\n.

    0.4 Fixed a bug that would cause an instance of the module to assume
    success on all subsequent connections once it had gotten its first
    successful connection.

    0.5 Changed the success test regexp so that "200 OK" is accepted as a
    successful reply from the proxy, since some report this instead of
    "200 Connection established".  Thanks to JoNO for pointing out this
    discrepancy.

    0.51 D'oh.  Broken regexp.
